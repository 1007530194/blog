<h2 id="Implementing-character-level-LSTM-text-generation">Implementing character-level LSTM text generation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Implementing-character-level-LSTM-text-generation">¶</a></h2><p>Let's put these ideas in practice in a Keras implementation. The first thing we need is a lot of text data that we can use to learn a 
language model. You could use any sufficiently large text file or set of text files -- Wikipedia, the Lord of the Rings, etc. In this 
example we will use some of the writings of Nietzsche, the late-19th century German philosopher (translated to English). The language model 
we will learn will thus be specifically a model of Nietzsche's writing style and topics of choice, rather than a more generic model of the 
English language.</p>

<p>As you can see, a low temperature results in extremely repetitive and predictable text, but where local structure is highly realistic: in 
particular, all words (a word being a local pattern of characters) are real English words. With higher temperatures, the generated text 
becomes more interesting, surprising, even creative; it may sometimes invent completely new words that sound somewhat plausible (such as 
"eterned" or "troveration"). With a high temperature, the local structure starts breaking down and most words look like semi-random strings 
of characters. Without a doubt, here 0.5 is the most interesting temperature for text generation in this specific setup. Always experiment 
with multiple sampling strategies! A clever balance between learned structure and randomness is what makes generation interesting.</p>
<p>Note that by training a bigger model, longer, on more data, you can achieve generated samples that will look much more coherent and 
realistic than ours. But of course, don't expect to ever generate any meaningful text, other than by random chance: all we are doing is 
sampling data from a statistical model of which characters come after which characters. Language is a communication channel, and there is 
a distinction between what communications are about, and the statistical structure of the messages in which communications are encoded. To 
evidence this distinction, here is a thought experiment: what if human language did a better job at compressing communications, much like 
our computers do with most of our digital communications? Then language would be no less meaningful, yet it would lack any intrinsic 
statistical structure, thus making it impossible to learn a language model like we just did.</p>
<h2 id="Take-aways">Take aways<a class="anchor-link" href="#Take-aways">¶</a></h2><ul>
<li>We can generate discrete sequence data by training a model to predict the next tokens(s) given previous tokens.</li>
<li>In the case of text, such a model is called a "language model" and could be based on either words or characters.</li>
<li>Sampling the next token requires balance between adhering to what the model judges likely, and introducing randomness.</li>
<li>One way to handle this is the notion of <em>softmax temperature</em>. Always experiment with different temperatures to find the "right" one.</li>
